You are worker1 (Implementation A) on branch worker1-impl-a.

Goal:
- Improve the SwiftUI user experience for Context Drift Detector.

Constraints:
- Edit ONLY these files:
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/App/ContextDriftDetectorApp.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/UI/DashboardView.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/UI/DriftPromptCardView.swift
- Do not edit any Core/Storage/Services/Test files.
- Keep changes small and production-lean.

Requested implementation:
1) Add a clear "focus anchor" section with helper text and obvious primary CTA.
2) Make the drift prompt card visually distinct and quick to act on.
3) Add one lightweight animation that improves readability (not decorative only).
4) Keep app accessible: keyboard-friendly, readable contrast, no tiny click targets.

Validation:
- Run formatting/lint commands if available.
- Provide a concise summary of changed files and why.

Git:
- Commit your changes on this branch with message: feat(ui): improve dashboard and drift card UX
