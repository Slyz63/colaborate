You are worker2 (Implementation B) on branch worker2-impl-b.

Goal:
- Improve drift detection and recovery behavior robustness.

Constraints:
- Edit ONLY these files:
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/App/DriftCoordinator.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/Core/AppSwitchMonitor.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/Core/DriftHeuristic.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/Core/Models.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/Storage/LocalStore.swift
  - Sources/ContextDriftDetector/Services/AppRestorer.swift
- Do not edit UI files or tests.

Requested implementation:
1) Avoid false positives from duplicate app-activation events.
2) Ensure drift detection only starts after anchor is explicitly started.
3) Keep intentional-break behavior predictable.
4) Improve app restore behavior from bundle ID reliably.
5) Keep summary persistence stable and deterministic.

Validation:
- Run tests/lint if available.
- Provide a concise summary and note any environment blockers.

Git:
- Commit your changes on this branch with message: feat(core): harden drift detection and recovery flow
