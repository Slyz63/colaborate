You are worker3 (Testing/Verification) on branch worker3-test.

Goal:
- Expand automated tests and add verification notes.

Constraints:
- Edit ONLY these files/folders:
  - Tests/ContextDriftDetectorTests/*
  - docs/verification.md (create if needed)
- Do not edit app/source files under Sources.

Requested implementation:
1) Add tests that cover boundary behavior in DriftHeuristic.
2) Add tests that verify LocalStore date-key behavior and round-trip summary data.
3) If runtime constraints block test execution, document exact failing command and reason.
4) Keep tests deterministic (fixed dates, no randomness).

Validation:
- Run tests and capture output summary.

Git:
- Commit your changes on this branch with message: test: extend heuristic and storage verification
